# FlutterFlow Issues 
FlutterFlow is a visual development enviornment for mobile and web apps. With FlutterFlow, developers can create beautiful, powerful, and clean applications faster than ever. This is an **issues-only repository** for tracking bug reports from the community. üêõ

The goal of this tracker is to report bugs that our team can reproduce. Sometimes, there's a lot going on in projects - and we're not able to reproduce the issue outside of your project. For issues that are project-specific, we may redirect you to support. If you think that it's specific to your project configuration, [please reach out to our support team](https://docs.flutterflow.io/miscellaneous/customer-support-policy). 

For suggestions about features and enhancements, please add your feedback using the feedback form in the product.

For discussions, and questions, please visit [FlutterFlow Community](https://community.flutterflow.io/). 


## How do I know when my issue will be available in production?
Our tracking system updates automatically, which means that when we merge a fix into the FlutterFlow codebase, the bug is closed. However, it can take up to two weeks to deploy a fix to production. Therefore, we ask that you give us two weeks after an issue was closed before re-opening it.


Thank you for helping make FlutterFlow more stable and improving the FlutterFlow experience for all users! üíú
